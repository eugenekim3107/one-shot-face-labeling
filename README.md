# One Shot Face Recognition

## What is it?
The one shot face recognition application identifies an individual's face within a group photo using only two inputs: a portrait of the person and the group photo itself.
## Why use it?
- Security and Surveillance: Enhancing security camera systems to identify suspects or persons of interest in crowded areas like airports, shopping centers, or public events.
- Event Management: Identifying attendees at events such as conferences, concerts, or sports events for access control or VIP recognition.
- Retail and Marketing: In retail environments, it could be used for personalized advertising or customer service by recognizing returning customers.
- Workplace Management: Monitoring attendance and tracking employee movements in large office spaces or factories.
